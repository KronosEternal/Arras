Hello Mate
Hi

There's something i need to talk to you about
I have no clue how to code
But i can be a good business man
So either i learn how to code or i do things on the less technical side of the server
I just wanna get to doing stuff and to be honest i cant type a line a js without something going wrong
Even if it means that im in a different branch then you and jonathan
I wanna still be apart of the team

good idea

Its just gonna be easier for all of us
Because I know how to do business, but not coding
and rn my kp chem grade is not doing the best
still an A, but we'll see how that is after the test...
Ethan if your looking at this before school ends I'm gonna call you after school to discusss this
