Im gonna be testing how many realities i can put on the  dev server before it crashed
Note: For all off these server speed decreased immensely on the first one, the other ones were just able
to finish the server off
Test #1: 4 Realities firing and 1 not firing     No hard crash
Test #2: 5 realities firing and a basic character not firing     No hard crash
Only got 1 reality firing and 1 reality not firing but i think Johnathan reset the serer on this attempt    Server reset

Im actualy gonna test what normal tank is the laggiest to see if you guys might be able to fix it

Please do on the (Glitch, Dev Server)
